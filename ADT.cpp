// Abstract data type =>

// We know that we have in-built data type such as => int , float , double , char etc in which we can perform some basic operations like => addition , substraction , multiplication etc . But there might be a situation in which we want to perform operations for our user defined data types which have to defined.In order to solve the problem , we create a data structure along some basic operations and such data structure that are not in-built are known as abstract data type (ADT).

// Abstract data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of values and a set of operations.The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented

// The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
