// Introduction of linked list 
// List is a collection of elements.There are two way of maintaining a list in computer memory.The first way is to take an array for storing the elements of the list .But array have some disadvantages.Insertion and deletion of an array element require more processing.If the number of elements are less than the size of the array then it will be the wastage of the memory.If the number of elements exceed the size of the array then also we will have problems.

// The second way of implementing a list is by using the self referential structure.These types of list are known as linked list.

// A linked list is made up of nodes where each node has two parts,first part contains the information and second part contains the address of the next node . The address part of the last node of linked list will be NULL.

// The nodes of a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory location.

// Ooperations on a linked list
// Traversal of linked list
//  searching an element 
//  Insertion of an element 
//  deletion of an element 
//  creation of a linked list
//  Reversal of a linked list

// Types of linked list
// (1) => Singly linked list
// (2) => Doubly linked list
// (3) => circular linked list
